We investigate the impact on basic quantum transport properties of disorder-induced exceptional
points (EPs) that emerge in a disorder-averaged Green’s function description of two-dimensional
(2D) Dirac semimetals with spin- or orbital-dependent potential scattering. Remarkably, we find
that EPs may promote the nearly vanishing conductance of a finite sample at the Dirac point to
a sizable value that increases with disorder strength. This striking behavior exhibits a strong directional 
anisotropy that is closely related to the Fermi arcs connecting the EPs. We corroborate our results by numerically exact simulations, thus revealing the fingerprints of characteristic non-Hermitian 
spectral features also on the localization properties of the considered systems. Finally,
several candidates for the experimental verification of our theoretical analysis are discussed, including 
disordered electronic square-net materials and cold atoms in spin-dependent optical lattices.
